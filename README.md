## About the Project
A **Python3** programms, which simulate using of processor time management and processor paging. "In one of those simulations using the FCFS algorithm, a generator is employed to create sample processes and the implemented algorithm sets the order of their execution by proccessor. In the same way it works with SJF algoritm, only using SJF rules to set the order of execution. To these algoritms is used generator, which create processes, the user can determine their number, duration and arrival times. The second part of projesct are implemmented algoritms of processor paging. I implemented FIFO and LRU algoritm. To this algoritms attached is generator, which randoms pages and number of frames
